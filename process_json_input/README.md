## Purpose

Exploring loading datasets into Rust as input for an indexing process.

### Choosing a Dataset

Open to ideas but thinking about wikipedia based sources.

The [Hutter Prize wiki dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jamesmcguigan/hutter-prize?resource=download) may work. Annoyingly, its in XML so I'll see how that goes with Rust.
